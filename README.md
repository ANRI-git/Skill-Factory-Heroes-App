# *Skill Factory* Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for *Avalith's bootcamp* named **Skill Factory** divided in two courses, one for React and other for Node. Here you will find my very first projects made in React and Node.js.
## *Heroes App* page
Third *Front-end* project made in **React** and **Node.js**.
It's a super-heroes search page. Here you can search any heroes from Marvel or DC Comics, connecting the page directly to a **Super-heroes API**.
